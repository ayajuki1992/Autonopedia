# Autonopedia

**Autonopedia** is a personal project for my University's Website Design & Development module. It's an encyclopedia dedicated to autonomous robots, and I’m using it to practice web development skills.

I’m uploading it to GitHub for version control and to get feedback. This is my first time using GitHub, and I’m new to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so the code might not be perfect. Any tips or suggestions are welcome!
